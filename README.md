   Week 2 (Wednesday PM through Sunday)

- This is a solo project - each student designs and builds a project over a 5-day hackathon. 

     - Students will teach themselves a new technology, language, or framework
     - They will record a 3-5 min video and upload to YouTube (like their Async Week Project)
     - They will present their video in a Zoom room to the class with opportunities to answer questions
        
3. **[Profile Enrichment Piece](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/2022-PILOT-program-guide-web-core/blob/main/04-sr-phase/07-portfolio-enrichment-piece/01-lesson-plan.md)** 

   Weeks 2 - 5 (Have topic picked in Week 2, draft complete in Week 4, and final due Friday of Week 5)

 - This is a solo assignment 
 
     - This is meant to enhance each student's graduation portfolio
 - Each student creates an article or video presenting a "deep dive" into a technical topic not explicitly covered in GHP's curriculum
 - Students will effectively communicate complex technical topics to a non-layman reader (or viewer)

     - Drafts will be created and reviewed by peers before finishing the project

4. **[Senior Capstone](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/2022-PILOT-program-guide-web-core/blob/main/04-sr-phase/04-capstone/01-Lesson-Plan.md)** 

   Weeks 3 - 6

 - Groups of 4 - 5 - create novel application that solves a problem
 - Students architect app using GHP curriculum and tech *theyâ€™ve used previously*.
 - Students demo their application, articulating the product goals in concise technical detail           
 - If using technologies not covered in class or in your PEP/ Async Week project:

    - Must be approved by member of instructional team
    - Can be used ONLY for features, not core functionality of your application (this means things like CSS libraries would be fine, but writing the entire app using a new framework that affects the actual functions is not allowed)
