# Outline-of-Senior-Projects
## Overview of projects

1. **[Grace Shopper](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/2022-PILOT-program-guide-web-core/tree/main/04-sr-phase/02-grace-shopper)** 

   Weeks 1 - 2 (Presenting on Wed. AM of Week 2)

   - similar to JPFP except uses authentication and has a shopping cart
   - Groups of 3 - 4 students
    
2. **[Stackathon](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/2022-PILOT-program-guide-web-core/tree/main/04-sr-phase/03-stackathon)** 

   Week 2 (Wednesday PM through Sunday)

- Each student designs and builds a project over a 5-day hackathon. 
- This is a solo project
        - Students will themselves a new technology, language, or framework
        - record a 3-5 min video and upload to YouTube (like Async Week Project)
        - (in groups of ~5), they will present their video in a Zoom room to the class
        
3. **[Profile Enrichment Piece](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/2022-PILOT-program-guide-web-core/blob/main/04-sr-phase/07-portfolio-enrichment-piece/01-lesson-plan.md) ** 

   Weeks 2 - 5 (Have topic picked in Week 2, draft complete in Week 4, and final due Friday of Week 5)

   - This is a solo assignment 
   - Each student creates an article or video presenting a "deep dive" into a technical topic not explicitly covered in GHP's curriculum
   - Students will effectively communicate complex technical topics to a non-layman reader (or viewer)
   - This is meant to enhance each student's graduation portfolio
   - Drafts will be created and reviewed by peers before finishing the project

4. **[Senior Capstone](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/2022-PILOT-program-guide-web-core/blob/main/04-sr-phase/04-capstone/01-Lesson-Plan.md)** 

   Weeks 3 - 6

   - Groups of 4 - 5 - create novel application that solves a problem
   - Students architect app using GHP curriculum and tech ***theyâ€™ve used previously***.
   - Students demo their application, articulating the product goals in concise technical detail
            
    - Using technologies not covered in class or in your PEP/ Async Week project:
    - Must be approved by member of instructional team
    - Can be used ONLY for features, not core functionality of your application (this means things like CSS libraries would be fine, but writing the entire app using a new framework that affects the actual functions is not allowed)
