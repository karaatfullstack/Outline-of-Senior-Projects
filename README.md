# Outline of Senior Projects
## Overview of projects

### 0. Async Week Project (AWP)
[General Link](https://github.com/karaatfullstack/Async-Week-Guide#-async-week-project-)

**Solo Project Comparison**
This is technically not part of senior phase, but since it is one of 5 total projects students complete, it's being included here. 
AWP is one of 3 solo projects you'll undertake at Grace Hopper, the other two being Stackathon and PEP.
- For AWP and Stackathon, you will build out an application using a technology of your choice. There is no threat of failure for these, they are simply an opportunity to learn something completely different from our curriculum. 
   - That said, building an entire project is optional - the main goal is to present a new topic to your classmates via a paragraph about what you learned, OR a walkthrough video.
- PEP is more in-depth and we expect a polished result. This one is meant to suppliment your developer portfolio, and therefore will be publicly-facing for potential employers. It can still be on any topic, but the information should be conveyed at a more advanced and professional level, via either YouTube video or Medium article.

**Notes**
There may be a topic you use for 2 of these 3 projects - that's fine. Many students see Stackathon as an extension of AWP, and others see PEP as an extention of Stackathon. As long as you are meeting the criteria, you can chose the same topic for two projects. The third project can also be related, but try to learn more than one technology between the three.


### 1. Grace Shopper Project (GSP)

   Weeks 1 - 2 (Presenting on Wed. AM of Week 2)

- Similar to JPFP except uses authentication and has a shopping cart
- Groups of 3 - 4 students
    
### 2. Stackathon

   Week 2 (Wednesday PM through Sunday)

- This is a solo project - each student designs and builds a project over a 5-day hackathon. 

     - Students will teach themselves a new technology, language, or framework
     - They will record a 3-5 min video and upload to YouTube (like their Async Week Project)
     - They will present their video in a Zoom room to the class with opportunities to answer questions
        
### 3. Profile Enrichment Piece (PEP)

[Student Page](https://github.com/karaatfullstack/Outline-of-Senior-Projects/blob/main/PEP.md)

Week 3 - Week 6
- This is a solo assignment, meant to enhance each student's graduation portfolio.

  - Each student creates an article or video presenting a "deep dive" into a technical topic not explicitly covered in GHP's curriculum
  - Students will effectively communicate complex technical topics to a non-layman reader (or viewer)
  - Drafts will be created and reviewed by peers before finishing the project

### 4. Senior Capstone

[Student Page](https://github.com/karaatfullstack/Outline-of-Senior-Projects/blob/main/Capstone.md)
   
   Weeks 3 - 6

 - Groups of 4 - 5 - create novel application that solves a problem
 - Students architect app using GHP curriculum and tech *theyâ€™ve used previously*.
 - Students demo their application, articulating the product goals in concise technical detail           
 - If using technologies not covered in class or in your PEP/ Async Week project:

    - Must be approved by member of instructional team
    - Can be used ONLY for features, not core functionality of your application (this means things like CSS libraries would be fine, but writing the entire app using a new framework that affects the actual functions is not allowed)
